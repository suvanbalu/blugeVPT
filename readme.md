## What is Bluge?

Bluge is an indexing/search library for Go.Developers can then search the index to find matching documents.

### What is a search functionality?

Users can quickly find information on a website using a search index. It is designed to map search queries to documents or URLs that might appear in the results.
When a user types in a search query, the search engine will find documents that include the search query. The results are returned from the index with a title, short content highlight, possibly a picture and a reference to the page URL.

### How are search-index made?

The search index for websites is created by crawlers â€“ also known as web crawlers and web spiders. In simple terms, the crawler visits the pages of the website and collects the contents from the website. This data is then converted into an index.

### How are data searched from index?

Once the user enter their keyword , the program searches for the keyword in all indexes and once the matching index is found and the results are returned from the index with a title, short content highlight, possibly a picture and a reference to the page URL.

### How a search-index can improve your website?

Search engines collect the content of your website automatically. Through an algorithm, your search results are prioritized. Some results will be given more weight, so they will show up before other pages on the results page.
